/*
External Buffer

Interfacing with foreign languages (C) through VHPIDIRECT:
https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/Foreign.html

An array of type uint8_t is allocated and some values are written to the first 1/3
positions. Then, the VHDL simulation is executed, where the (external) array/buffer
is used. When the simulation is finished, the results are checked. The content of
the buffer is printed both before and after the simulation.

This source file is used for both string/byte_vector and integer_vector.
Accordingly, TYPE must be defined as uint8_t or int32_t during compilation.
Keep in mind that the buffer (D) is of type uint8_t*, independently of TYPE, i.e.
accesses are casted.

NOTE: This file is expected to be used along with tb_ext_string.vhd, tb_ext_byte_vector.vhd
or tb_ext_integer_vector.vhd
