# If the test runner is placed in a component instantiated into the testbench, different architectures of that
# component can implement different tests and VHDL configurations can be used to select what test to run.
# This is the approach taken by a traditional OSVVM testbench. In VUnit, such a test becomes a VUnit configuration
# selecting the associated VHDL configuration rather than a VUnit test case, but that is of less importance. Note that
# this approach is limited in that the test runner architecture can't contain a test suite with explicit test cases
# (run function calls) but only the test_runner_setup and test_runner_cleanup calls. Should you need multiple test
# suites sharing the same test fixture (the DUT and the surrounding verification components), the proper approach
# is to put each test suite in its own testbench and make the test fixture a component reused between the testbenches.
# That approach do not require any VHDL configurations.
