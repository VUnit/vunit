[Questa/Modelsim] Added support for 3-step flow and the Visualizer debugger.

The 3-step flow is enabled by setting the simulation option ``modelsim.three_step_flow`` to ``True``. Extra
flags to the ``vopt`` step can be provided with the simulation flags ``modelsim.vopt_flags`` and
``modelsim.vopt_flags.gui`` in normal and GUI mode, respectively.

The Visualizer debugger is enabled from the command line using the ``--debugger=visualizer`` option (in
addition to the ``--gui`` option for GUI mode). The 3-step flow must be enabled for this feature while
the default ``original`` debugger works with or without the 3-step flow.

Note: There is a bug in Visualizer preventing the normal ``restart`` command from being used. Please use the
``vunit_restart`` command instead.
