[Questa/Modelsim] Added support for 3-step flow which is enabled by setting the
simulation option ``modelsim.three_step_flow`` to ``True``. Extra flags to the ``vopt``
step can be provided with the simulation flags ``modelsim.vopt_flags`` and
``modelsim.vopt_flags.gui`` in normal and GUI mode, respectively.
