Bumped OSVVM to 2024.07.

The seed generation of OSVVM has changed to a new algorithm which may cause some testbenches using InitSeed(some_value)
to fail since the random sequence of values doesn't reproduce what was previously generated. This can occur if the testbench
has assumptions on the random sequence that aren't explicitly enforced (other than setting the seed).
