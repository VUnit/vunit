The AXI stream standard requires tdata to be a multiple of 8 bits. VUnit VCs allowed non-standard widths but the tkeep and tstrb
signals didn't cover the most significant bits beyond the last full byte. For example, if the tdata width was 12 bits, tkeep and tstrb
were one bit corresponding to the least significant byte in tdata. The 4 most significant bits didn't have a corresponding tkeep
bit.

Starting in VUnit v5.0.0-dev2, the check features for AXI stream were updated such that comparison of the actual tdata value with the
expected one, only considers bytes for which tkeep and tstrb are set. As a consequence, the upper bits of non-standard width tdata,
for which there is no tkeep and tstrb bits, were not considered for comparison.

The VCs have now been updated to extend tkeep and tstrb in these cases such that all bits in tdata are considered for comparison.
Existing testbenches using non-standard widths *and* tkeep or tstrb will have to be updated as the ports are one bit wider.
