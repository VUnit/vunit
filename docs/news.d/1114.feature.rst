Added support for test prioritization with two goals in mind:

1. Prioritize likely failures - Tests more likely to fail are executed earlier to provide faster feedback.
2. Load balancing - When tests are executed in parallel using the -p option, VUnit will try to keep the threads balanced to minimize total execution time.

Added the ``--changed`` option that limits tests to those that depend on changes made after the last test run.
