Provided a unique base seed to every simulation. From that base seed any number of unique seed can derived
to initialize the random number generators in the testbench. Unique seeds increase the test coverage for
randomized tests over time as they are executed repeatedly by the user and the CI. The seed can be overrideen
from the command line with the --seed option in order to reproduce failing tests.
