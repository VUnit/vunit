[GHDL/NVC] Arbitrary waveform viewers are now supported by passing the `--viewer`
command line arugment. As a consequence, ``ghdl.gtkwave_script.gui`` and
``nvc.gtkwave_script.gui`` are deprecated in favour of ``ghdl.viewer_script.gui``
and ``nvc.viewer_script.gui``, respectively. The ``--gtkwave-args`` and
``--gtkwave-fmt`` command line argument is deprecated in favour of ``--viewer-args``
and ``--viewer-fmt``, respectively. ``ghdl.viewer.gui`` and ``nvc.viewer.gui`` can
be used to set the preferred viewer from the run-file. Finally, if the requested
viewer does not exists, ``gtkwave`` or ``surfer`` is used, in that order. This
also means that VUnit uses ``surfer`` if ``gtkwave`` is not installed.

[NVC] It is possible to get VCD waveform files by passing ``--viewer-fmt=vcd``.
