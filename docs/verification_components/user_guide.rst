Verification Component Library
===============================

.. note:: This library is released as a *BETA* version. This means
          non-backwards compatible changes are still likely based on
          feedback from our users.

The VUnit Verification Component Library (VCL) contains a number of
useful :ref:`Verification Components <verification_components>` (VC)
as well as a set of utilities for writing your own verification
component. Verification components allow a better overview in the test
bench by raising the abstraction level of bus transactions. Even if
you do not need the advanced features that VCs offer you may still
benefit from using per-verified models of an AXI-bus instead of
re-implementing it yourself.

Included verification components (VCs):

- Avalon Memory-Mapped master
- Avalon Memory-Mapped slave
- Avalon Streaming sink
- Avalon Streaming source
- AXI-Lite master
- AXI read slave
- AXI write slave
- AXI stream master
- AXI stream monitor
- AXI stream protocol checker
- AXI stream slave
- RAM master
- Wishbone master
- Wishbone slave
- UART master
- UART slave

In addition to VCs VUnit also has the concept of :ref:`Verification
Component Interfaces <verification_component_interfaces>` (VCI). A
single VC typically implements several VCIs. For example an AXI-lite
VC or RAM master VC can support the same generic bus master and
synchronization VCI while also supporting their own bus specific VCIs.

.. TIP:: The main benefit of generic VCIs is to reduce redundancy between
   VCs and allow the user to write generic code that will work regardless
   of the specific VC instance used. For example control registers might be
   defined as a RAM-style bus in a submodule but be mapped to an AXI-lite
   interface on the top level. The same testbench code for talking to the
   submodule can be used in both the submodule test bench as well as the
   top level test bench regardless of the fact that two different VCs
   have been used. Without generic VCIs copy pasting the code and
   changing the type of read/write procedure call would be required.

Neither a VC or a VCI there is the :ref:`memory model <memory_model>`
which is a model of a memory space such as the DRAM address space in a
computer system. The memory mapped slave VCs such as AXI and Wishbone
make transactions against the memory model which provides access
permissions, expected data settings as well as the actual buffer for
reading and writing data.

Verification Component Interfaces
---------------------------------

A verification component interface (VCI) is a procedural interface to
a VC. A VCI is defined as procedures in a package file. Several VCs can
support the same generic VCI to enable code re-use both for the users
and the VC-developers.

List of VCIs included in the main repository:

Included verification component interfaces (VCIs):

* :ref:`Bus master <bus_master_vci>`: generic read and write of bus with address and byte enable.
* :ref:`Stream <stream_vci>`: push and pop of data stream without address.
* :ref:`Synchronization <sync_vci>`: wait for time and events.

Verification Components
-----------------------

A verification component (VC) is an entity that is normally connected
to the DUT via a bus signal interface such as AXI-Lite. The main test
sequence in the test bench sends messages to the VCs that will then
perform the actual bus signal transactions. The benefit of this is
both to raise the abstraction level of the test bench as well as
making it easy to have parallel activity on several bus interfaces.

A VC typically has an associated package defining procedures for
sending to and receiving messages from the VC. Each VC instance is
associated with a handle that is created in the test bench and set as
a generic on the VC instantiation. The handle is given as and argument
to the procedure calls to direct messages to the specfic VC instance.
