Check Library
=============

Introduction
------------

The check library is an assertion library for VHDL providing the more commonly used assertions as a number of check
procedures and functions.

Architecture
------------

Most check subprograms are conditional log messages. If the condition represents a failing check then an error message
is issued using the VUnit :doc:`log package <../logging/user_guide>`.

Every check you perform is handled by a checker. There is a default checker that is used when none is specified but you
can also create multiple custom checkers. For example

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(re = '1', "Expected active read enable at this point");

will use the default checker while

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(my_checker, re = '1', "Expected active read enable at this point");

will use the custom ``my_checker``. A custom checker is just a variable or constant initialized with the ``new_checker``
function.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    constant my_checker : checker_t := new_checker("my_checker");

All subprograms presented in this user guide are available for both the default checker and custom checkers. The
difference is the first ``checker`` parameter which only exists for custom checker subprograms. To make the user guide
more compact, we present this as an optional parameter using square brackets. For example

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function check_false(
     [constant checker   : in checker_t;]
      constant expr      : in boolean;
      constant msg       : in string      := result(".");
      constant level     : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural   := 0;
      constant line_num  : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name : in string      := "")
      return boolean;

The full verbose API description can always be found in :ref:`check\_api.vhd <check_api>` and :ref:`checker\_pkg.vhd
<checker_pkg>`.

Checker Creation
----------------

Since a check is a conditional log, it uses a logger from the logging library described in the :doc:`logging user guide
<../logging/user_guide>` internally.

A checker is created based on the logger to use or the name of that logger. If the named logger doesn't exist, it will
be created. Additionally, there is also a ``default_log_level`` parameter that can be used to specify the default log
level of failing checks.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function new_checker(logger_name : string;
                                default_log_level : log_level_t := error) return checker_t;
    impure function new_checker(logger            : logger_t;
                                default_log_level : log_level_t := error) return checker_t;

Check
-----

The check library provides a basic ``check`` procedure which is similar to the VHDL ``assert`` statement:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(re = '1', "Expected active read enable at this point");

The first parameter is the boolean expression to be evaluated, and the second parameter is the error message that will
be issued if the expression is false. Assuming this check fails, and you haven't changed the default settings for the
default checker, the error message will be:

.. code-block:: console

    10000 ps - check -  ERROR - Expected active read enable at this point

If you wish to have a log level other than the one set by default via the ``new_checker`` function, you can override
this for each check call. For example,

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(re = '1', "Expected active read enable at this point", failure);

A failing check is always counted as a failure, no matter the severity level specified. However, the level determines
whether the simulation stops, which is controlled by the stop level for the internal logger. The stop level can be
changed by retrieving the logger and then use the ``set_stop_level`` procedure as described in the :doc:`logging user
guide <../logging/user_guide>`. For example,

.. code-block:: vhdl

    set_stop_level(get_logger(my_checker), warning);

Note that when using the VUnit Python test runner, the default checker stop level is set to ``error`` when calling
``test_runner_setup``. This is because the Python test runner has the capability to restart the simulation with the next
test case, ensuring that the error state of the failing test case won't be propagated into subsequent tests. If the
Python test runner isn't being used, then the stop level is set to ``failure``, allowing for continued execution on
``error``, but without the assurance that the error state won't be passed on.

Logging Passing Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provided message in a check call is logged when the check passes, allowing for the creation of a debug trace to help
investigate what occurred before a bug. This feature uses the ``pass`` log level, which is not visible by default, but can
be made visible for any log handler.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    show(get_logger(default_checker), display_handler, pass);

The difference between a passing check log message and a failing check log message is
the log level used. A passing check like this

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(re = '1', "Checking that read enable is active");

will result in a log entry like this

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - PASS - Checking that read enable is active

Note that a message that reads well for both the pass and the fail cases was used.

A number of check subprograms perform several checks for every call, each of which can fail and generate an error
message. However, there will only be one pass message for such a call to avoid confusion. For example, ``check_stable``
checks the stability of a signal for every clock cycle in a window. If the window is 100 clock cycles there will be 100
checks for stability but there will only be one pass message, not 100, if the signal is stable.

Message Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous examples the outputs from passing and failing checks were the messages provided by the user with the
addition of a timestamp, the logger name and the log level. If we change the log format to ``raw`` there would be no
additions at all, just the user message. However, the check subprograms may also add information to the user message
before the log format additions are applied. For example, checking a pixel value after an image processing operation can
be done like this:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_equal(output_pixel, reference_model(x, y), "Comparing output pixel with reference model");

Resulting in an error message like this:

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - Comparing output pixel with reference model - Got 1111_1010 (250). Expected 249 (1111_1001).

The last part of the message provides an error context to help debugging. Such a context is only given if that provides
extra information. In the case of a failing ``check`` we know that the input boolean is false so there is no need to
provide that information. The context may also be different between pass and error messages. For example, a pass message
from ``check_equal`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - PASS - Comparing output pixel with reference model - Got 1111_1010 (250).

Redundancy is avoided by excluding the expected value which is the same as the value received.

So far we've used a message that reads well in both the passing and the failing case. The check library also provides
another way of doing this using the ``result`` function. The call

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_equal(output_pixel, reference_model(x, y), result("for output pixel"));

gives the following messages:

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - Equality check failed for output pixel - Got 1111_1010 (250). Expected 249 (1111_1001).

and

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - PASS - Equality check passed for output pixel - Got 1111_1010 (250).

The ``result`` function prepends the provided string with the check type (equality check in this case) and assigns
either a passed or failed label based on the result. This function is also used as the default argument for all check
calls. For example,

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_equal(output_pixel, reference_model(x, y));

gives the following messages:

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - Equality check failed - Got 1111_1010 (250). Expected 249 (1111_1001).

and

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - PASS - Equality check passed - Got 1111_1010 (250).

If you look at the default value for the user messages in the check subprogram APIs, you will see that the ``result``
function isn't used. This is a workaround for one of the supported simulators which exposes the internal implementation
of the ``result`` function (a magic constant prepending the user message). You shouldn't use the magic constant yourself
since that implementation may change at any time. For that reason we're also keeping the ``result`` function in the APIs
presented in this user guide.

Check Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``check`` subprograms described in the previous sections have three additional parameters, ``path_offset``,
``line_num`` and ``file_name``. These parameters allow the location of a failing chaeck to be included in the error
message. This is furter described in the :doc:`log user guide <../logging/user_guide>`.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check(
     [constant checker     : in checker_t;]
      constant expr        : in boolean;
      constant msg         : in string      := result(".");
      constant level       : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num    : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in string      := "");

Acting on Failing Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``check`` subprogram described so far doesn't reveal whether the check passed or failed. If you want that
information to control the flow of your test, and your testbench is setup to continue on a failing check, you have a
number of options. You can use the check functions which return ``true`` on a passing check and ``false`` when they
fail.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function check(
     [constant checker     : in  checker_t;]
      constant expr        : in  boolean;
      constant msg         : in  string      := result(".");
      constant level       : in  log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural      := 0;
      constant line_num    : in  natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in  string      := "")
      return boolean;

Or you can use check procedures with a boolean ``pass`` output returning the same information.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check(
     [constant checker     : in  checker_t;]
      variable pass        : out boolean;
      constant expr        : in  boolean;
      constant msg         : in  string      := result(".");
      constant level       : in  log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural      := 0;
      constant line_num    : in  natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in  string      := "");

Or you can use any of the following subprograms to get more details.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function get_checker_stat[(
      constant checker : in  checker_t);]
      return checker_stat_t;

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure get_checker_stat (
     [constant checker : in  checker_t;]
      variable stat    : out checker_stat_t);

``checker_stat_t`` is a record containing pass/fail information:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    type checker_stat_t is record
      n_checks : natural;
      n_failed : natural;
      n_passed : natural;
    end record;

Note that a check subprogram with multiple internal checks may generate multiple error messages if it's configured not
to stop on error. Each of these errors will result in the values of both ``n_checks`` and ``n_failed`` increasing by
one. However, if the check passes, ``n_checks`` and ``n_passed`` will only be increased by one. The rationale behind
this is identical to that of the single-pass message approach, which seeks to prevent any discrepancies between the
number of passing check subprogram calls and the associated statistical data.

Managing Checker Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A checker will continuously update its statistics counters as new check subprograms are called. If you want to collect
the statistics for parts of your test you can make intermediate readouts using the ``get_checker_stat`` subprograms and
then reset the counters to zero using:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure reset_checker_stat [(
      constant checker : in checker_t)];

Another way of collecting statistics for different parts is to use several separate checkers.

Variables of type ``checker_stat_t`` can be added to or subtracted from each other using the normal ``-`` and ``+``
operators. There is also a ``to_string`` function defined to allow for logging/reporting of statistics, for example

.. code-block:: vhdl

    info(to_string(get_checker_stat));

Postponed Check Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The action taken on a failing check is usually to create a log, as demonstrated in the preceding chapters. It is also
possible to postpone the action by separating it from the fail/pass analysis of the check. Doing so provides us with an
opportunity to complete other tasks before finalizing the check even if an error leads to a simulation stop.

This postponed approach is based on a check function which returns a ``check_result_t`` type:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function check(
       [constant checker    : in checker_t;]
       constant expr        : in boolean;
       constant msg         : in string      := result(".");
       constant level       : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
       constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
       constant line_num    : in natural     := 0;
       constant file_name   : in string      := "")
       return check_result_t;


The ``check_result_t`` type contains all the necessary information to perform a log action at a later point in time.
This is achieved with the ``log`` function, which takes the ``check_result_t`` as its only parameter. As an example,

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_result := check(re = '1', "Checking that read enable is active");

    -- Perform custom tasks

    log(check_result);

In addition to the log action, another predefined action, ``notify_if_fail``, is available. This action triggers a
notification event when a check fails, allowing remote event observers to take appropriate actions. After raising this
notification, ``notify_if_fail`` will then call ``log`` on the result of the check.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    notify_if_fail(check(re = '1', "Checking that read enable is active"), vunit_error);

For more information about how to use ``notify_if_fail`` in your test, please refer to the :doc:`event user guide
<../data_types/event_user_guide>`.

When separating the action from the analysis there is a risk that the user forgets to call the action procedure after
the custom tasks have been performed. To prevent that such a mistake leads to an undetected error, VUnit keeps track of
all postponed actions that have yet to be handled. If, during the execution of a check, an error is detected and no
postponed action is performed, then the ``test_runner_cleanup`` procedure will fail with an "unhandled checks" error.

.. note::

    The postponed check action is currently available for a limited set of sequential checks. See the :ref:`check API
    <check_api>` for the latest status.

Check Types
-----------

In addition to the basic ``check`` subprograms the check library also provides a number of more specialized checks.
These checks can be divided into four different types:

* Point checks
* Relation checks
* Sequential checks
* Unconditional checks

These types and the checks belonging to each type are described in the following chapters.

Point Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common to all point checks is that the condition for failure is evaluated at a single point in time, either when the
subprogram is called as part of sequential code or synchronous to a clock in a clocked, usually concurrent procedure
call. There are six unclocked versions of each point check, corresponding to the two boolean functions and four
procedures previously described for ``check``. The only difference in the respective parameter lists is that the boolean
``expr`` parameter is replaced by one or more parameters specific to the point check.

The unclocked procedures have the following format. The four variants comes from the different combinations of using the
two first optional parameters.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check<_name>(
      [constant checker     : in  checker_t;]
      [variable pass        : out boolean;]
      <specific parameters>
      constant msg         : in string      := result<(".")>;
      constant level       : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num    : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in string      := "");

The boolean functions have the following format.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function check<_name>(
      [constant checker     : in  checker_t;]
      <specific parameters>
      constant msg         : in  string      := result<(".")>;
      constant level       : in  log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num    : in  natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in  string      := "")
      return boolean;

The clocked procedures follow a format with and without the optional ``checker`` parameter. These procedures are also
available for ``check``.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check<_name>(
     [constant checker           : in checker_t;]
      signal clock               : in std_logic;
      signal en                  : in std_logic;
      <specific parameters>
      constant msg               : in string      := result<(".")>;
      constant level             : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant active_clock_edge : in edge_t      := rising_edge;
      constant path_offset       : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num          : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name         : in string      := "");

``edge_t`` is an enumerated type:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    type edge_t is (rising_edge, falling_edge, both_edges);

The condition for failure is continuously evaluated on the clock edge(s) specified by ``active_clock_edge``, so long as
``en = '1'``. For constant evaluation of the check procedure, you can tie the ``en`` input to the predefined ``check_enabled`` signal.

The figure below shows an example using the concurrent version of ``check``.

.. figure:: images/check_true.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

``expr`` is evaluated on every rising clock edge, except when ``en`` is low on edge 3. This means the check will pass
despite the false ``expr`` in the third clock cycle.

(True) Check (check and check\_true)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+-------------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                    |
+=====================+=========================+
| expr                | boolean or std\_logic   |
+---------------------+-------------------------+

``check_true`` is a more verbose alternative to ``check`` which clearly expresses the expectation that the ``expr``
evaluates to ``true``, ``1``, or ``H``. The extra verbosity is also present when the ``result`` function is used.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check(false, result("for my data.");

will result in

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - Check failed for my data.

while

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_true(false, result("for my data.");

will result in

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - True check failed for my data.

False Check (check\_false)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+-------------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                    |
+=====================+=========================+
| expr                | boolean or std\_logic   |
+---------------------+-------------------------+

``check_false`` passes when ``expr`` is ``false``, ``0``, or ``L``.

+=====================+=========================+
| antecedent\_expr    | boolean or std\_logic   |
+---------------------+-------------------------+
| consequent\_expr    | boolean or std\_logic   |
+---------------------+-------------------------+

The unclocked subprograms use ``boolean`` parameters while the clocked procedures use ``std_logic``.

``check_implication`` checks logical implication and passes unless ``antecedent_expr`` is ``true``, ``1``, or ``H`` when
``consequent_expr`` is ``false``, ``0``, or ``L``.

Not Unknown Check (check\_not\_unknown)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                               |
+=====================+====================================+
| expr                | std\_logic\_vector or std\_logic   |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+

``check_not_unknown`` passes when ``expr`` contains none of the metavalues ``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-``.

Zero One-Hot Check (check\_zero\_one\_hot)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+----------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                 |
+=====================+======================+
| expr                | std\_logic\_vector   |
+---------------------+----------------------+

``check_zero_one_hot`` passes when ``expr`` contains none of the metavalues ``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-`` and
there are zero or one bit equal to ``1`` or ``H`` .

One-Hot Check (check\_one\_hot)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+----------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                 |
+=====================+======================+
| expr                | std\_logic\_vector   |
+---------------------+----------------------+

``check_one_hot`` passes when ``expr`` contains none of the metavalues ``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-`` and there is
exactly one bit equal to ``1`` or ``H`` .

Relation Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relation checks are used to check whether or not a relation holds between two expressions, for example if ``(a + b) =
c``. They support the following six unclocked formats.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check_<name>(
     [constant checker         : in  checker_t;]
     [variable pass            : out boolean;]
      <specific parameters>
      constant msg             : in string := result;
      constant level           : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset     : in natural     := 0;
      <preprocessor parameters>);

.. code-block:: vhdl

    impure function check_<name>(
     [constant checker         : in  checker_t;]
      <specific parameters>
      constant msg             : in string := result;
      constant level           : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset     : in natural     := 0;
      <preprocessor parameters>)
      return boolean;

.. _equality_check:

| Preprocessor Parameter   | Type      | Default Value   |
+==========================+===========+=================+
| line\_num                | natural   | 0               |

``check_equal`` passes when ``got`` equals ``expected``. When comparing ``std_logic`` values with ``boolean`` values
``1`` equals ``true`` and all other ``std_logic`` values equal ``false``. Note that the ``std_logic`` don't care (``-``)
only equals itself. If you want an equality like ``"0011" = "00--"`` to pass, you should use ``check_relation`` with the
matching equality operator (``?=``) or ``check_match`` instead.

If a check fails you will get a context on the following format.

.. code-block:: console

    Got <got value>. Expected <expected value>.

When you compare bit vectors, ``integer``, and ``natural`` type of values, the error message will output the values on
both formats. For example, here is a context when a ``check_equal`` between an ``integer`` and a ``signed`` value fails.

.. code-block:: console

    Got 17 (0001_0001). Expected 0001_0000 (16).

Real value checks
'''''''''''''''''
Exact comparison of real values is often not desirable; therefore, there is a variant of ``check_equal``, which takes an
argument ``max_diff``. If the absolute difference between the received and expected values is larger than ``max_diff``,
then the check fails.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_equal(0.1, 0.2, max_diff => 0.1); -- Passes
    check_equal(0.1, 0.2, max_diff => 0.05); -- Fails

.. code-block:: console

    Equality check passed - Got abs (0.1 - 0.2) <= 0.1.
    Equality check failed - Got abs (0.1 - 0.2) > 0.05.


Relation Check (check\_relation)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+---------------------+--------------------------------+
| Specific Parameter  | Type                           |
+=====================+================================+
| expr                | boolean, std\_ulogic, or bit   |
+---------------------+--------------------------------+

+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| Preprocessor Parameter   | Type      | Default Value   |
+==========================+===========+=================+
| context\_msg             | string    | ""              |
+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| line\_num                | natural   | 0               |
+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| file\_name               | string    | ""              |
+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+

``expr`` is intended to be a relational expression and three different types are supported. In case a matching
relational operator is used, the relation will return a ``std_ulogic`` or ``bit`` depending on the operands. All other
relations will return a ``boolean``.

``check_relation`` passes when ``expr`` evaluates to ``true`` in the boolean case and to ``1`` in the ``std_ulogic`` and
``bit`` cases. This means that the ``boolean`` case behaves just like ``check`` and ``check_true``. The additional value
of this check comes when you enable the check preprocessor in your VUnit run script.

.. code-block:: python

    ui = VUnit.from_argv()
    ui.enable_check_preprocessing()

The check preprocessor scans your code for calls to ``check_relation`` and then parses ``expr`` as a VHDL relation. From
that it will generate a context (``context_msg`` parameter) describing how the relation failed. For example, the check

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_relation(real_time_clock <= timeout, "Response too late");

will generate the following error message if it fails.

.. code-block:: console

    1000 ps - check - ERROR - Response too late - Expected real_time_clock <= timeout. Left is 23:15:06. Right is 23:15:04.

This works for **any** type of relation between **any** types as long as the operator and the ``to_string`` function are
defined for the types involved. In the example above the operands are of a custom ``clock_t`` type for which both the
``<=`` operator and the ``to_string`` function have been defined.

Note that ``context_msg`` is the empty string by default, so without the check preprocessor, the error message will only
be the ``msg`` provided by the user.

Relations with Side Effects
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The left and right hand sides of the relation are evaluated twice: once when the relation is initially evaluated, and
again to create the error message. Let's say you have a call like this:


.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_relation(counter_to_verify = get_and_increment_reference_counter(increment_with => 3));

The reference counter will be incremented with 6, which is not what is expected from looking at the code.

Conclusion: Do not use impure functions in your expression. If you have an impure function you should call it once and
assign the value to a temporary variable before calling ``check_relation``:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    ref_cnt := get_and_increment_reference_counter(increment_with => 3);
    check_relation(counter_to_verify = ref_cnt);

In this case, where we have an equality relation, we can also use ``check_equal``. This procedure has the left and right
hand operands separated in the call itself, thus eliminating the need for a second evaluation in order to create the
error message.

Fooling the Parser
''''''''''''''''''

The check preprocessor has a simplified parser to determine what the relation operator in the expression is, and what
the left and right hand operands are. For example, it knows that this is an inequality since ``/=`` is the only relational
operator on the "top-level":

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_relation((a = b) /= (c = d));

It also knows that this isn't a relation since there's no relational operator on the top-level:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_relation((a = b) and c);

Such a call will result in a syntax error from the check preprocessor:

.. code-block:: console

    SyntaxError: Failed to find relation in check_relation((a = b) and c)

However, its knowledge about precedence is limited to parenthesis so it will not understand that this identical
expression isn't a relation:

.. code-block:: vhdl

    check_relation(a = b and c);

If this logical expression returns false, the check will generate an error message claiming that a relation failed and
that ``a`` was the left value and ``b and c`` was the right value.

Conclusion: Use ``check_relation`` for relations as intended!

It should also be noted that the parser can handle that there are relational operators within the check call but outside
of the ``expr`` parameter. For example, it won't be fooled by the relational operators appearing within strings and
comments of a call.

Match Check (check\_match)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+-------------------+
| Specific Parameter|
+===================+
| got               |
+-------------------+
| expected          |
+-------------------+

The ``got`` and ``expected`` parameters can have the following combination of types

+----------------------+----------------------+
| got                  | expected             |
+======================+======================+
| unsigned             | unsigned             |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| std\_logic\_vector   | std\_logic\_vector   |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| signed               | signed               |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| std\_logic           | std\_logic           |
+----------------------+----------------------+

+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| Preprocessor Parameter   | Type      | Default Value   |
+==========================+===========+=================+
| line\_num                | natural   | 0               |
+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| file\_name               | string    | ""              |
+--------------------------+-----------+-----------------+

``check_match`` passes when ``got`` equals ``expected`` but differs from ``check_equal`` in that a don't care (``-``)
bit equals anything.

Sequence Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sequence checks are checks that use several clock cycles to determine
whether or not the desired property holds.

Stability Check (check\_stable)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``check_stable`` supports four different clocked formats. The ``expr`` parameter can be ``std_logic`` or
``std_logic_vector`` and the call can be made with or without the initial custom checker parameter.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check_stable(
     [constant checker           : in checker_t;]
      signal clock               : in std_logic;
      signal en                  : in std_logic;
      signal start_event         : in std_logic;
      signal end_event           : in std_logic;
      signal expr                : in std_logic or std_logic_vector;
      constant msg               : in string      := result;
      constant level             : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant active_clock_edge : in edge_t      := rising_edge;
      constant allow_restart     : in boolean     := false;
      constant path_offset       : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num          : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name         : in string      := "");

``check_stable`` passes if the ``expr`` parameter is stable in the window defined by the ``start_event`` and
``end_event`` parameters. The window starts at an active (as per ``active_clock_edge``) and enabled (``en = '1'``)
clock edge for which ``start_event = '1'`` and it ends at the next active and enabled clock edge for which ``end_event =
'1'``. ``expr`` is sampled for a reference value at the start event and is considered stable if it keeps that reference
value at all enabled and active clock edges within the window, including the clock edge for the end event. Bits within
``expr`` may change drive strength (between ``'0'`` and ``'L'`` or between ``'1'`` and ``'H'``) and still be considered
stable. Below is an example with two windows that will pass.

.. figure:: images/check_stable_passing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

Here are two examples of failing checks. Note that any unknown value (``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-``) will cause
the check to fail even if the unknown value is constant. The check will also fail if either ``start_event`` or
``end_event`` has an unknown value in the active window.

.. figure:: images/check_stable_failing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

``check_stable`` can handle one clock cycle windows and back-to-back windows.

When ``allow_restart`` is ``false``, ``check_stable`` will ignore additional start events in the window. When
``allow_restart`` is ``true`` a new window is started if a new start event appears before the end event. The previous
window is implicitly closed in the clock cycle before the new start event. An end event will still close the window if
it appears before a second start event.

Next Check (check\_next)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``check_next`` supports two different formats. One with and one without the initial custom checker parameter.

.. code-block:: vhdl

   procedure check_next(
     [constant checker           : in checker_t;]
      signal clock                 : in    std_logic;
      signal en                    : in    std_logic;
      signal start_event           : in    std_logic;
      signal expr                  : in    std_logic;
      constant msg                 : in    string      := result;
      constant num_cks             : in    natural     := 1;
      constant allow_overlapping   : in    boolean     := true;
      constant allow_missing_start : in    boolean     := true;
      constant level               : in    log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant active_clock_edge   : in    edge_t      := rising_edge;
      constant path_offset         : in    natural     := 0;
      constant line_num            : in    natural     := 0;
      constant file_name           : in    string      := "");

``check_next`` passes if ``expr = '1'`` ``num_cks`` active (as per ``active_clock_edge``) and enabled (``en = '1'``)
clock edges after a start event. The start event is defined by an active and enabled clock edge for which ``start_event
= '1'``. Below is an example of a passing check. The start event is sampled at clock edge two and ``expr`` is expected
to be high four enabled clock edges after that which is at clock edge seven due to ``en`` being low at clock edge five.

.. figure:: images/check_next_passing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

When ``allow_overlapping`` is ``true``, ``check_next`` will allow a new start event before the check based on the
previous start event has been completed. Here is an example with two overlapping and passing sequences.

.. figure:: images/check_next_passing_with_overlap.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

In case ``allow_overlapping`` is ``false``, ``check_next`` will fail at the second start event.

When ``allow_missing_start`` is ``true``, ``check_next`` will allow ``expr = '1'`` when there is no corresponding start
event. When ``allow_missing_start`` is ``false``, such a situation will lead to a failure. Here is an example where
``expr`` is at ``'1'`` for one cycles with no corresponding start event.

.. figure:: images/check_next_passing_with_missing_start.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

Any unknown value  (``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-``) on ``start_event`` will cause an error.

``check_next`` will handle the weak values ``L`` and ``H`` in the same way as ``0`` and ``1``, respectively.

Sequence Check (check\_sequence)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``check_sequence`` supports two different formats. One with and one without the initial custom checker parameter.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check_sequence(
     [constant checker             : in checker_t;]
      signal clock                 : in std_logic;
      signal en                    : in std_logic;
      signal event_sequence        : in std_logic_vector;
      constant msg                 : in string          := result;
      constant trigger_event       : in trigger_event_t := penultimate;
      constant level               : in log_level_t     := null_log_level;
      constant active_clock_edge   : in edge_t          := rising_edge;
      constant path_offset         : in natural         := 0;
      constant line_num            : in natural         := 0;
      constant file_name           : in string          := "");

``check_sequence`` checks whether a series of events, represented by the bits in the ``event_sequence`` parameter, are
activated (with bit values of ``'1'`` or ``'H'``) in order at consecutive active (as per ``active_clock_edge``) and
enabled (``en = '1'``) clock edges. Furthermore, the behavior of the procedure can be changed based on the argument
``trigger_event`` which has three distinct options for operation.

-  ``first_pipe`` - The sequence is started when the leftmost bit of ``event_sequence`` is activated. This will also
   trigger ``check_sequence`` to verify that the remaining bits are activated at the following active and enabled clock
   edges. ``check_sequence`` will also verify new sequences starting before the first is completed.

The figure below shows two overlapping sequences that pass:

.. figure:: images/check_sequence_first_pipe_passing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

In this example the sequence is started but not completed and the check fails:

.. figure:: images/check_sequence_first_pipe_failing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

-  ``first_no_pipe`` - Same as ``first_pipe`` with the exception that only one sequence is verified at a time. New
   sequences starting before the previous is verified will be ignored.

In this example we have two sequences: the first is completed while the second is interrupted. However, since only one
sequence is handled at a time, the second is ignored and the check pass.

.. figure:: images/check_sequence_first_no_pipe_passing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

-  ``penultimate`` - The difference with the previous modes is that ``check_sequence`` only verifies the last event (the
   rightmost bit) when all the preceding events in the sequence have been activated. This means that a started sequence
   that is interrupted before the second to last bit is activated will pass. ``check_sequence`` will also verify new
   sequences starting before the first is completed.

The figure below shows two overlapping sequences which pass and then an early interrupted sequence that doesn't cause a
failure in this mode (which it did in the example for the ``first_pipe`` mode).

.. figure:: images/check_sequence_penultimate_passing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

In this example the sequence is interrupted after the second to last bit is activated and the check fails.

.. figure:: images/check_sequence_penultimate_failing.png
   :align: center
   :alt:


Any unknown values (``U``, ``X``, ``Z``, ``W``, or ``-``) in ``event_sequence`` will lead to a an error. This is
regardless of the mode of operation.

Unconditional Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The check library has two unconditional checks, ``check_passed`` and ``check_failed``, that have no expression
parameter to evaluate. They are used when the pass/fail status is already given by the program flow. For example,

.. code-block:: vhdl

    if <some condition> then
      <do something>
      check_passed;
    else
      <do something else>
      check_failed("This was not expected");
    end if;

With no ``expr`` parameter there are also fewer usable formats for these checkers.

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check_passed(
      [constant checker    : in checker_t;]
      constant msg         : in string      := result(".");
      constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num    : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in string      := "");

.. code-block:: vhdl

    procedure check_failed(
     [constant checker     : in checker_t;]
      constant msg         : in string      := result(".");
      constant level       : in log_level_t := null_log_level;
      constant path_offset : in natural     := 0;
      constant line_num    : in natural     := 0;
      constant file_name   : in string      := "");
