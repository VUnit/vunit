.. _compile_options:

Compilation Options
-------------------

Compilation options allow customization of compilation behavior. Since simulators have
differing options available, generic options may be specified through this interface.
The following compilation options are known.

``ghdl.a_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to ``ghdl -a`` command during compilation.
   Must be a list of strings.

``ghdl.flags``
  Deprecated alias of ``ghdl.a_flags``. It will be removed in future releases.

``incisive.irun_vhdl_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to the Incisive ``irun`` command when compiling VHDL files.
   Must be a list of strings.

``incisive.irun_verilog_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to the Incisive ``irun`` command when compiling Verilog files.
   Must be a list of strings.

``modelsim.vcom_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to ModelSim ``vcom`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``modelsim.vlog_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to ModelSim ``vlog`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``rivierapro.vcom_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to Riviera PRO ``vcom`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``rivierapro.vlog_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to Riviera PRO ``vlog`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``activehdl.vcom_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to Active HDL ``vcom`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``activehdl.vlog_flags``
   Extra arguments passed to Active HDL ``vcom`` command.
   Must be a list of strings.

``enable_coverage``
   Enables compilation flags needed for code coverage and tells VUnit to handle
   the coverage files created at compilation. Only used for coverage with GHDL.
   Must be a boolean value. Default is False.

.. note::
   Only affects source files added *before* the option is set.

.. _sim_options:

Simulation Options
------------------

Simulation options allow customization of simulation behavior. Since simulators have
differing options available, generic options may be specified through this interface.
The following simulation options are known.

``vhdl_assert_stop_level``
  Will stop a VHDL simulation for asserts on the provided severity level or higher.
  Valid values are ``"warning"``, ``"error"``, and ``"failure"``. This option takes
  precedence over the fail_on_warning attribute.

``disable_ieee_warnings``
  Disable ieee warnings. Must be a boolean value. Default is False.

.. _coverage:

``enable_coverage``
  Enables code coverage collection during simulator for the run affected by the sim_option.
  Must be a boolean value. Default is False.

  When coverage is enabled VUnit only takes the minimal steps required
  to make the simulator create a unique coverage file for the
  simulation run.

  For RiverieraPRO and Modelsim/Questa, the VUnit users must still set :ref:`sim
  <sim_options>` and :ref:`compile <compile_options>` options to
  configure the simulator specific coverage options they want. The
  reason for this to allow the VUnit users maximum control of their
  coverage settings.

  For GHDL with GCC backend there is less configurability for coverage, and all
  necessary flags are set by the the ``enable_coverage`` sim and compile options.

  An example of a ``run.py`` file using coverage can be found
  :vunit_example:`here <vhdl/coverage>`.

  .. note: Supported by GHDL with GCC backend, RivieraPRO and Modelsim/Questa simulators.


``pli``

``modelsim.init_files.after_load``
   A list of user defined DO/TCL-files that is sourced after the design has been loaded.

   as the path of the folder containing the test bench.
   Must be a list of strings.

``modelsim.init_files.before_run``
   A list of user defined DO/TCL-files that is sourced before the simulation is run.

   by ``vunit_restart``).
   Must be a list of strings.

``modelsim.init_file.gui``
   A user defined TCL-file that is sourced after the design has been loaded in the GUI.

   as the path of the folder containing the test bench.
   Must be a string.

``rivierapro.vsim_flags``

   There are currently limitations in the HEAD revision of GTKWave that prevent the
   user from sourcing a list of scripts directly. The following is the current work
   around to sourcing multiple user TCL-files:
   ``source <path/to/script.tcl>``
