- New coverage support:

    The ``--coverage`` flag has been removed in favor of exposing a
    more flexible :ref:`coverage interface <coverage>`. The flag was
    was not flexible enough for many users and we decided to make a
    breaking change to get a better solution moving forward. An
    example of using the new interface can be found here
    :vunit_example:`here <vhdl/coverage>`. For users who liked the old
    flag VUnit supports adding :ref:`custom <custom_cli>` command line
    arguments.
