Features
~~~~~~~~

- [NVC] Added code coverage support. (:vunit_issue:`984`)


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated contexts to include missing packages. (:vunit_issue:`1094`)
- Added warning when attempting to set NVC `--exit-severity` via `nvc.sim_flags` (:vunit_issue:`1132`)
- Improved error messaging if the NVC and GHDL environment variables are used for other purposes than naming the
  executable. (:vunit_issue:`1149`)
- Restrict setup tools to pre-82, as the deprecated pkg_resources is still used.

  This is a short-term workaround. A properly updated setup will be released later. (:vunit_issue:`1158`)
