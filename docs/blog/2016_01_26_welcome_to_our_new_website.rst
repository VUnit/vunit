Welcome to Our New Website
==========================
.. image:: img/vunit_github_io.png

Today I moved VUnit from my personal GitHub account to a dedicated
`VUnit account <https://www.github.com/VUnit/vunit>`__. Links to the
previous account are redirected to the new so your clones of VUnit
should not be affected. However, I suggest you update your remote
location to avoid any confusion.

::

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/VUnit/vunit.git

With the new account comes a new website
`VUnit.github.io <http://VUnit.github.io>`__. One of the purposes with
this site is to concentrate information to one place instead of
publishing posts on LinkedIn like I've done before. We will continue to
improve on this site to complement the functionality already available
in the VUnit GitHub repository which you can always reach by clicking
the GitHub cat icon at the bottom of this page. There you will also find
links to the `YouTube
channel <https://youtube.com/channel/UCCPVCaeWkz6C95aRUTbIwdg>`__,
`mail <mailto:vunitframework@gmail.com>`__, and our newly created
`twitter account <https://www.twitter.com/VUnitFramework>`__ which you
can follow to receive VUnit related news.
