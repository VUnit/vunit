One month ago we released VUnit 3.0 which was a release focused on our
BFM support. Our previous BFM building blocks were extended and
further simplified, we added new building blocks, and also a number of
complete BFMs. By putting a lot of effort into the building blocks we
hoped to encourage the VUnit community to develop and publish their
own BFM work and that has now paid off. Thanks to great work from
`Slawomir Siluk <https://github.com/VUnit/vunit/pull/312>`__ we now
have Wishbone in the list of supported BFMs!

Do you have BFMs that you would like to see or are you interested in
participating in such a community collaboration? Just post an issue on
our `Github page <https://github.com/VUnit/vunit/issues>`__ to get the
process started.
