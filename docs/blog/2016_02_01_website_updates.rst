Website Updates
===============

.. figure:: img/blogging_chat_room_documentation.png

Our website has been updated with a
`Gitter <https://gitter.im>`__-based
`chat <https://gitter.im/VUnit/vunit>`__ and an improved
`documentation <http://vunit.github.io/documentation.html>`__ platform
based on `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__. When
changing to Sphinx it came natural to also switch the blogging platform
to `ABlog <http://ablog.readthedocs.org/>`__ which is based on Sphinx.

The chat has just been active for a few days but it's already very
active. Currently it's used to port VUnit to Cadence Incisive. We don't
have such licenses but the chat has been used to support the porting
work done by people that do. FOSS collaboration at its best!
