Recently I got a question from an ASIC team if it is possible to
integrate their VUnit simulations with Matlab. I've been getting this
question several times lately so this post will show you how it can be
done. It will be based on their use case but hopefully it will serve
as inspiration if you have other Matlab use cases or want to integrate
VUnit with some other program.

The Testbench
-------------

The ASIC team had a slow high-level testbench that they wanted to
monitor by continuously visualizing the progress of the implemented
algorithm in the form of a Matlab plot. To emulate that slow test I
created a testbench which doesn't have a DUT implementing an algorithm
but simply generates a sequence of output samples itself. The output
samples are generated by repeatedly calling a function
`get_output_sample` that I made really slow by adding an internal delay
loop. The samples generated form a simple ramp function as shown in
the figure below.

Here is the main loop of my VUnit testbench.

.. code-block:: vhdl

  test_runner: process is
    variable data_set : integer_array_t;
  begin
    test_runner_setup(runner, runner_cfg);

    for set in 1 to num_of_data_sets loop
      data_set := new_1d;

      for data in 1 to size_of_data_set loop
        append(data_set, get_output_sample);
      end loop;

      save_csv(data_set, join(output_path(runner_cfg), "data_set_" & to_string(set) & ".csv"));
      deallocate(data_set);
    end loop;

    test_runner_cleanup(runner);
  end process;

The code consists of two nested loops. The inner loop creates a
`data_set` with a number of output samples and the outer loop creates
several such sets. The samples in a data set is the latest progress of
my algorithm, the "progress report" I send to Matlab.

`data_set` is declared as an `integer_array_t` from VUnit's
`integer_array_pkg`. This package allows you to manage one-, two- or
three-dimensional arrays of integers and provides procedures for
storing such arrays on file. Some of you may have seen the VUnit
`array_t` before. `integer_array_t` is basically the same thing but
it's a regular type rather than a protected type. The reasons for this
were discussed in my previous `post
<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vunit-30-while-waiting-vhdl-2017-lars-asplund/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B5b9rV7igQdWD8WMA5ZZshg%3D%3D>`__.

In this case I have a one-dimensional array (a vector) created by

.. code-block:: vhdl

  data_set := new_1d;

The created vector is empty by default and grows dynamically with every new sample I append.

.. code-block:: vhdl

  append(data_set, get_output_sample);

Once I have a complete data set I save that to a CSV file and then
deallocate the data set such that I can repeat the procedure.

.. code-block:: vhdl

  save_csv(data_set, file_name => join(output_path(runner_cfg), "data_set_" & to_string(set) & ".csv"));
  deallocate(data_set);

The file name probably deserves a comment. `output_path(runner_cfg)` returns a test unique output directory that VUnit provides to the testbench via the ever-present `runner_cfg` generic. I assign a unique name to every CSV file based on the data set number, for example `data_set_3.csv`, and then create the full path by concatenating the directory and file names using the `join` function.

The Run Script
--------------

The run script is similar to most run scripts with a few additions

.. code-block:: python

  prj = VUnit.from_argv()
  prj.add_array_util()

  root = dirname(__file__)
  lib = prj.add_library("lib")
  lib.add_source_files(join(root, "test", "*.vhd"))
  tb_octave = lib.entity("tb_octave")

  tb_octave.add_config(name="Passing test",
                       generics=dict(size_of_data_set=10,
                                     num_of_data_sets=10,
                                     activate_bug=False),
                       pre_config=make_pre_config("Passing test", num_of_data_sets))

  prj.main()

The VUnit array support is an add-on not compiled into `vunit_lib` by
default. To include it you have to add

.. code-block:: vhdl

  prj.add_array_util()

Next I want to create a configuration for my testbench. A VUnit configuration allows me to run my testbench with several different settings. In this example my testbench entity is called `tb_octave` and I get the testbench, compiled into `lib`, with the line

.. code-block:: python

  tb_octave = lib.entity("tb_octave")

Using the `add_config` method I can now add a configuration to the
testbench which I named `Passing test`.

.. code-block:: python

  tb_octave.add_config(name="Passing test",
                       generics=dict(size_of_data_set=10,
                                     num_of_data_sets=10,
                                     activate_bug=False),
                       pre_config=make_pre_config(plot_title="Passing test", num_of_data_sets=10))

The configuration first sets a number of testbench generics collected
in a Python dictionary (a list of key/value pairs). You've already
seen the purpose of `size_of_data_set` and `num_of_data_sets` but I
also have a generic `activate_bug` which I will use later to activate
a bug in the `get_output_sample` function. I've also added something
called a `pre_config` function. This is a function that VUnit calls
before starting the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

  def pre_config(output_path):
      p = run(["octave", join(root, "octave", "visualize.m"), output_path, plot_title, str(num_of_data_sets)])

      return p.returncode == 0

`pre_config` takes a mandatory `output_path` argument which is the
same directory we saw in the testbench before. Note that the
`output_path` name doesn't mean that it can't be used for simulation
input. A `pre_config` function can for example be used to generate and
store an input data file in `output_path` and let the testbench read
that data.

In this example I use `pre_config` to call Matlab (or rather Octave
which is a free Matlab clone) using the Python `run` function. Octave
is called with a Matlab M script, `visualize.m`, located in the
`<root>/octave` directory. The script takes three arguments - the
output path where the testbench stores the CSV files to plot, the
title of the plot to be created, and the number of data sets that
Octave should expect.

But where are `plot_title` and `num_of_data_sets` defined? `pre_config` is called by VUnit and it can only provide arguments it knows about. VUnit knows about the `output_path` it created but doesn't know anything about the purpose of the `pre_config` function and what it needs to fulfill that purpose. I can hardcode these values but what if I want to reuse `pre_config` with different values? The trick is to generate the `pre_config` function.

.. code-block:: python

  def make_pre_config(plot_title, num_of_data_sets):
      def pre_config(output_path):
          p = run(["octave", join(root, "octave", "visualize.m"), output_path, plot_title, str(num_of_data_sets)])

          return p.returncode == 0

      return pre_config

The `make_pre_config` function has defined `pre_config` locally and
returns that function to the caller of `make_pre_config`. Since
`figure_title` and `num_of_data_sets` are arguments to
`make_pre_config` they are also visible for `pre_config`, just like
they would be for a local function in VHDL. It might seem strange that
`pre_config` remembers the values of these arguments once the function
has been returned and is used elsewhere. This is known as a closure
and you can read more about it `here
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>`__.

The Matlab Script
-----------------

I'm not a Matlab programmer but the reference manual helped me creating a script that seems to work. Based on the input arguments it creates a named plot and then waits for input files in the output directory. Every new file is read and appended to the plot. I also added a test to see if the plotted graph is monotonically increasing as intended. If so, the script creates an empty file named `pass`. If not, a file named `fail` is created.

.. code-block:: matlab

  % Parse arguments
  arg_list = argv;
  output_path = arg_list{1};
  plot_title = arg_list{2};
  num_of_data_sets = arg_list{3};

  % Configure figure
  fig = figure('Name', 'Testbench Progress');
  title(plot_title)
  xlabel("x")
  ylabel("y")
  xlim([0 100])
  ylim([0 100])
  hold on

  % Wait on data set files and plot
  data = [];
  for s = 1:str2num(num_of_data_sets)
    file_name = fullfile(output_path, strcat("data_set_", int2str(s), ".csv"));
    while not(exist(file_name, 'file'))
      pause(0.1)
    end
    data_set = csvread(file_name);
    data = [data, data_set];
    x = 0 : length(data) - 1;
    plot(x, data)
  end

  % Verify that the data set is monotonically increasing
  if sum(data(1:length(data)-1) >= data(2:length(data))) == 0
    f = fopen(fullfile(output_path, "pass"), "w");
  else
    f = fopen(fullfile(output_path, "fail"), "w");
    disp("ERROR: Output is not monotonically increasing!")
  end
  fclose(f);

  % Quit when figure is closed
  pause(1)
  waitfor(fig);

The next step is to let the pass/fail files determine the faith of my
testbench. This can be done with a VUnit `post_check` function. I
works just like the `pre_config` function but runs after the
testbench.

.. code-block:: python

  def post_check(output_path):
      for i in range(10):
          if exists(join(output_path, "pass")):
              return True
          elif exists(join(output_path, "fail")):
              return False

          sleep(1)

      return False

If a pass file is found within 10 seconds the function returns `True`,
otherwise `False`. A `pre_config` or `post_check` function returning `False`
will cause my test to fail just like a failing assert within my
testbench would.

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

To demonstrate both the passing and the failing case I've created two
configurations for this testbench using a for loop. Note how
`make_pre_config` allows me to reuse the `pre_config` function with
different values for `plot_title`.

.. code-block:: python

  size_of_data_set = 10
  num_of_data_sets = 10

  for name, activate_bug in [("Passing test", False), ("Failing test", True)]:
      tb_octave.add_config(name=name,
                           generics=dict(size_of_data_set=size_of_data_set,
                                         num_of_data_sets=num_of_data_sets,
                                         activate_bug=activate_bug),
                           pre_config=make_pre_config(plot_title=name, num_of_data_sets=num_of_data_sets),
                           post_check=post_check)

The result is shown in this short clip

The good thing about the solutions I provided is that it makes it is
fairly easy to get started. You can download the code and adapt it for
your needs. If you didn't know about VUnit configurations and arrays
you've also learned something that is useful in many other
situations. However, leaving aside my limited Matlab skills, there are
still a number of flaws with this solution. For example

- With the CSV support provided by VUnit and Matlab it became easy to
  split the data into sets and store them in separate files. I would
  prefer writing and reading a single open file.
- Copying and modifying code is not good reuse. I need to raise the
  abstraction and remove details.
- Responsibility for the plot is all over the place. The testbench is
  in charge of the data, the title is set by the Python script, axis
  labels are controlled by the M script, and some properties are
  hardcoded.

It seems that I will have to revisit this post. Until then...
