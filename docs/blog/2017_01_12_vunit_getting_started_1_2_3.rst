VUnit - Getting Started 1-2-3
=============================

I recently started a LinkedIn blog series about getting started with VUnit. The
first three parts are:

1. `Installing VUnit in 1 minute <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vunit-best-value-initial-effort-lars-asplund>`__
2. `Compiling your project in 1 minute <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vunit-best-value-initial-effort-part-2-lars-asplund>`__
3. `Automating your testbenches with 5 lines of code <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vunit-best-value-initial-effort-part-3-lars-asplund>`__

Three more blogs are planned. They will cover:

4. Improve testbench speed and quality with test cases
5. Daily work with VUnit
6. Testbench configurations
