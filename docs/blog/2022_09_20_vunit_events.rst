* A way to spot where the testbench is stuck on timeout or other errors.

Introduction
------------

Testbench code often requires the use of multiple concurrent processes to achieve various objectives.
These processes may be independent and run without regard to one another, or they may need to be synchronized to
coordinate their activities. An example of the first is an independent process driving a clock
and a common example of the latter is a bus functional model (BFM) that waits for another process to provide the
necessary address and data for the next bus transaction.

VUnit provides an event mechanism to facilitate such synchronization between processes. An event in this context
indicates that something has happened and can be used to notify other processes about that happening.
The other processes can then wait for the event to become active before proceeding with their tasks.

Before proceeding we need to distinguish the VUnit event mechanism from similar concepts. For example, VHDL
has its own event concept for signals, which allows processes to wait for a signal event using the wait statement.

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/wait_on_signal_event.html

A common misunderstanding is that the wait statement will be activated if the process responsible
for driving the ``new_data_set`` signal makes an assignment to it. However, this is not the case.
In VHDL, the wait statement will remain blocked unless there is a **change** in the value of the signal. Let's say
the core of the data producing process is as follows:

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/notify_with_boolean_event.html

The process waiting for data looks like this:

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/listening_to_vhdl_events.html

If the intial value of ``new_data_set`` is ``false``, the waiting process will react to the first assignment,
but miss all subsequent events and data. To fix this issue,  we can use the ``transaction`` attribute on the signal.
Every VHDL assignment is considered a *transaction* and the process below should not miss any data.

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/listening_to_vhdl_transactions.html

This is confirmed by the simulation trace log, which shows that the latter receiving process works as intended, while
the first process misses all but the first event.

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/non_toggling_event_log.html

Another solution to this problem is to toggle the event signal rather than setting it to ``true``:

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/notify_with_toggling_event.html

Although the signal name may now seem a bit misleading, we no longer need the ``transaction`` attribute for the wait
statement to function properly, as shown in this log:

.. raw:: html
    :file: img/vunit_events/toggling_event_log.html


There are also other approaches that can be used, but the main point is that creating events that behave as intended
requires an understanding of the inner workings of VHDL, and such details are better hidden behind an abstraction
to prevent confusion and mistakes. By establishing an abstraction, it is also possible to further extend the event
functionality without adding unnecessary complexity to the user's code. These are the main motivations for the
VUnit event types.

This is a similar step to how the design of synchronous processes has evolved over time. Previously, they were based
on the ``clk'event and clk = '1'`` condition, but now the more common approach is to use ``rising_edge(clk)``. The
latter hides the details of VHDL events and is a more powerful solution. While the previous solution would react to a
``std_logic`` ``clk`` changing from ``X`` to ``1``, or even worse from ``H`` to ``1``, the latter correctly does not.

Another synchronization mechanism that is often confused with the VUnit style of events is the binary semaphore.
The main difference is that an event occurs at a **point in time**, and a process starting to wait for an event will
block until the **next** event occurs. Binary semaphores, on the other hand, have a binary state. One of the states,
often denoted with the integer 1 and representing the availablity of some resource, allow a process to proceed
immediately regardless of whether the state was active when the process started waiting. There is no need for something
to happen, an event, in order for the process to proceed. A semaphore checks its state first and only if the value is 0
there is a need to wait for the event indicating that the state has been set to 1. After a process has been allowed to
proceed, it will set the semaphore value to 0 to prevent other processes from claiming the resource.

Events can be used not only to build semaphores, but also to create other, more complex synchronization mechanisms.
VUnit message passing is an example of such a mechanism that is based on events.
If you have used it, you may have noticed the ``net`` signal appearing in many subprogram calls and wondered what it
is used for. The answer is that ``net`` is an event that indicates that something has happened in the message passing
system. In addition to the ``net`` event, VUnit provides other events that are useful to users. We will discuss some of
these events in this blog.

Two Types of VUnit Events
-------------------------

VUnit events come in two types: ``basic_event_t`` and ``event_t``. ``basic_event_t`` events, such as ``net``, are
provided by the VUnit framework and behave similarly to user-defined events of type ``event_t``. The main difference is
that basic events are predefined rather than dynamically created. Predefined events enable us to create a
cleaner architecture within VUnit where low-level functionality can use events without creating many dependencies on
other parts of VUnit. However, from a user-point of view the basic events behave very similar to user-defined events and
provide the same user interface. For that reason we'll start explaining ``event_t`` before presenting the basic
events.

User-Defined Events
-------------------

User-defined events can be created from identities (see :ref:`identity package <id_user_guide>`) or directly from a
name string. In the latter case an identity is created automatically for that name unless it already exists.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/event_creation.html


.. important::

    An event is always declared as a signal.

In the following example, we have two processes: the ``test_runner`` process and the ``dut_checker``
process. ``test_runner`` generates stimuli input for the device under test (DUT) and ``dut_checker``
verifies the DUT's response to that stimuli. The stimuli is created from a number of data set files
and ``test_runner`` starts by pushing the total number of samples in each set to a VUnit queue. Next, it notifies
``dut_checker`` via the ``new_data_set`` event. ``test_runner`` then pushes the individual sample values to the same
queue.

The code below shows the body of the ``test_runner`` process but also a ``test_runner_watchdog``. We'll
get back to that later.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/test_runner_process.html

If the queue is empty, the ``dut_checker`` process waits for the ``new_data_set`` event to be activated using the
``is_active`` function. When the event arrives, ``dut_checker`` pops the number of samples to expect from the queue.
It then waits for that number of outputs from the DUT, and for each output it pops the corresponding input sample from
the queue in order to calculate the expected output. The expected value is then compared to the actual value. The
``dut_checker`` process operates in parallel with the ``test_runner`` process but is slightly separated in time due to
the latency of the DUT.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/dut_checker.html

After ``dut_checker`` has received and checked the expected number of values it will
look for a new data set in the queue and wait if not already present. In this case there is no need to wait
because ``test_runner`` is applying the data sets back-to-back and operates ahead of ``dut_checker``
due to the DUT's latency.

The design described in the previous sections has a major issue that needs to be addressed: when ``test_runner`` has
driven the last sample of the last data set, it directly calls the ``test_runner_cleanup`` function before the DUT has
processed and output the result of all stimuli. As a result, there are DUT outputs that are never verified. One common
fix for this problem is to insert a wait statement before the ``test_runner_cleanup`` function that adds a few clock
cycles of delay, allowing the DUT pipeline to drain of all remaining data. However, this is a very dangerous solution
as it relies on the latency of the DUT remaining constant. If the latency of the DUT increases due to updates to the
design, the delay may not be sufficient and the issue will reappear. Additionally, if there is a bug that causes the
DUT not to produce all outputs, or perhaps no outputs at all, the delay will expire regardless of how much safety
margin is added, resulting in a potentially faulty test being marked as passing. A more robust solution is needed to
ensure that all results are properly verified.

The key here is that we've assigned the task of verifying the output to the ``dut_checker`` process. Only this process
can determine when the task is fully completed. Therefore, we will create a second event called ``dut_checker_done``.
``dut_checker`` will signal this event when it has verified a data set and can't find any new input in the queue. It
will still go and wait for more input in case it comes later.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/done_event.html

In ``test_runner`` we add a safety barrier by waiting for this event before calling ``test_runner_cleanup``.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/wait_done_event.html


In this case we're using ``is_active_msg`` instead of ``is_active``. It has the same function but also produces a log
message when the input event is active.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/is_active_msg.html

Also note that we gave the event a hierarchical name ``dut_checker:done``, i.e.
the event ``done`` is owned by the ``dut_checker`` (pretty-printing of the identity hierarchy is done by the
``get_tree`` function in the :ref:`identity package <id_user_guide>`).

With the new event we have a more solid strategy for terminating the simulation, so let's experiment to see what happens
if a new bug in the DUT causes it to stop producing data prematurely:

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/timeout_due_to_bug.html

The ``test_runner_watchdog`` mentioned previously helps us identify this issue, and in this simple
example, it's relatively easy to find the root cause. However, in more complex situations, it can be challenging to
know where to begin debugging because there are many potential points where the testbench may become stuck. VUnit
provides a number of basic events that are useful in situations like these.

VUnit-Provided Events
---------------------

A method to identify blocking wait statements that cause the simulation to timeout is to use the VUnit-provided
``runner_timeout`` event in combination with the ``log_active`` function. The ``log_active`` function produces a
log message just like ``is_active_msg`` but it always returns ``false``. This means it can be used to identify
blocking wait statements without unblocking them. We can use this in the ``dut_checker`` wait statement.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_active.html

This addition will create an extra log entry and the location information pinpoints the exact location of the
wait statement.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_after_log_active.html

If you are using Active-HDL or Riviera-PRO and compiling your code with VHDL-2019, log location is automatically
supported. If that is no option, you can use VUnit's location preprocessor to achieve the same result
(see :ref:`log location <logging/user_guide:Log Location>`). If you are not using either of these options, the extra
entry (or entries if you have multiple wait statements) will not be helpful. However, there are other ways to identify
the problematic wait statement(s):

1. Use a Custom logger

  We can create a logger representing ``dut_checker`` using either identities or a name string like this:

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/dut_checker_logger.html

  Next, we hand ``dut_checker_logger`` to the ``log_active`` function.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/custom_logger.html

  This will bring our log message closer to the source (``dut_checker``) should we not have the exact location.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_with_dut_checker_logger.html

2. Use a Custom Message

  In case ``dut_checker`` has several wait statements and we want to know which one is stuck, we can add a
  message to ``log_active``.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/custom_message.html

  The source of the problem is easier to identify but at the expense of losing information about why the log
  entry was produced (the runner:timeout event was activated).

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_with_custom_message.html

3. Use a Decorated Message

  We can restore the lost event information by using a decorated message. Decoration is done with the ``decorate``
  function which combines the automatically generated information with a message provided by the user. This technique
  may be familiar to those who have used the ``result`` function in check subprograms. ``result`` implements the same
  idea and is actually an alias for ``decorate``.

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/decorated_message.html

  The resulting log is as follows:

  .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_with_decorated_message.html

Using events to identify blocking wait statements is useful not only for timeout errors, but for any type of error.
VUnit offers a more generic ``vunit_error`` event that is activated in addition to the ``runner_timeout`` event and
can be activated from other error sources as well, including errors found by the testbench itself.

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/vunit_error.html

Let's say we have a requirement on the maximum latency for our DUT and we want to check that. To do that we decide to
apply the first data set on the DUT input, wait for the maximum latency, and then read a status register in the DUT
containing a field with the number of processed samples. We expect that field to be the number of samples applied
if the latency is within the requirement. This piece of code is placed after the loop applying all samples in a data
set.

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/check_latency.html

.. TIP::
    Register fields in VHDL can be defined by creating an integer subtype with the range set to the range of bits
    occupied by the field. In this case ``n_samples_field`` is defined as:

    .. raw:: html
        :file: img/vunit_events/n_samples_field.html

Running this code reveals that only half of the applied samples have been processed after the maximum latency.

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_for_check_latency.html

If we could notify ``vunit_error`` when we encounter this error, we would expect ``dut_checker``'s wait statement
for output data to create a log entry since not all data have been produced. That would help confirming the latency
issue. To do that we need to divide the ``check_equal`` procedure into two parts: the analysis and the action. The
analysis compares the expected and actual number of samples, while the action logs an error in response to a failing
equality as determined by the analysis.

The ``check_equal`` procedure has an equivalent function that only performs the analysis and returns the
result. There is also a ``log`` procedure that takes the result as input and performs the action part. To address the
issue we are facing, we want to have an alternative action procedure that notifies ``vunit_error`` if the result
indicates a failing equality and *then* calls the ``log`` procedure. This alternative action procedure, called
``notify_if_fail``, is already provided and takes the analysis result and an event to notify on failure as input.

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/notify_if_fail.html

Running the simulation again reveals the following log:

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/log_for_check_latency_with_vunit_error.html

The ``dut_checker`` isn't stuck where we expected it to be. Instead it is waiting for the next data set which suggests
that all of the expected output data have been received before the max latency, and we should look for the bug
elsewhere. It turns out that the root cause of the issue is an error in the range definition of the ``n_samples_field``.
The range is shifted one bit which causes the read value to be half of the actual value. The additional information
provided by the wait statements triggered by ``vunit_error`` can be very helpful in situations like these, as it can
confirm our initial suspicions or direct us towards another possible explanation.

You may have noticed that the wait statement triggered in this case wasn't prepared with a call to the ``log_active``
function. So, how was the log entry generated? What we did was to create a
:class:`VUnit preprocessor <vunit.ui.preprocessor.Preprocessor>` to identify wait statements and then modified them to
include a call to ``log_active``. This allowed us to automatically generate log entries for wait statements not prepared
to generate extra debug information. The design of such a preprocessor somewhat depends on the project setup but you can
use this example as a template for your own project.

 .. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/wait_statement_preprocessor.html

The preprocessor is added to the project using the :meth:`~vunit.ui.VUnit.add_preprocessor` method. The order number must be higher than that of the location preprocessor which is 1000 by default. This is to avoid unintended interference between the two.

.. raw:: html
      :file: img/vunit_events/add_preprocessor.html

.. admonition:: Exercise

   Create a preprocessor that wraps check procedures in a ``notify_if_fail`` call such that all detected errors
   triggers the ``vunit_error`` event.

Close, but No Cigar
-------------------

So far VUnit events helped us synchronize processes, reveal blocking wait statements to aid debugging, and prevent
premature termination of a simulation. However, using events to create a barrier for premature terminations is a
solution with several problems:

1. It doesn't scale well. For every process that has to complete we need a new event.
2. There is a race condition. If a process completes before the test runner process starts waiting for the completion
   event, the test runner process will block and never call ``test_runner_cleanup`` to end the simulation.
3. If we fail to recognize that there is a completion event for a process, or simply forget to add it, we still face
   the risk of a premature simulation termination.

A better solution would be one that allows any process to prevent ``test_runner_cleanup`` from ending the simulation
before that process has completed. There is only one ``test_runner_cleanup`` call so it scales well and forgetting to
add it will cause the testbench to fail. The event race condition is also removed since a process completing before the
test runner process reaches ``test_runner_cleanup`` will have stopped preventing simulation termination.

Fortunately VUnit provides such a solution. It's called VUnit phases and it will be the topic for the next blog.
